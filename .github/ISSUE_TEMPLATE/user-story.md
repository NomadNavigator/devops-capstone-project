So that I can easily monitor the performance of the product and make data-driven decisions

Details and Assumptions
The dashboard should display metrics such as user acquisition, retention rates, revenue, and user engagement.
Data should be updated in real-time or near real-time.
The dashboard should be accessible via a web interface.
Users should be able to filter data by date range and other relevant criteria.
The interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate.
